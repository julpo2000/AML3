# Fewshot learning on Weight Agnostic Neural Networks
Our experiments are based on https://weightagnostic.github.io/. A copy of the github of this paper can be found in the weightagnostic_original folder. 
We changed some elements of this code to run our own experiments. Our experiments can be run by running experiments.sh. This will automatically do the training and testing. It will train a network architecture in the normal way, using only one single weight value, and in the fewshot way by having multiple different weight values. These can then be compared against each other. The number of epochs during training can be changed in the weightagnostic_original/prettyNeatWann/p/laptop_swing.json file.
